Each Provider will provide its open "Open-*Connection" cmdlet...
    Open-OracleConnection, Open-SqlConnection, Open-SQLiteConnection, Open-PostGreConnection, Open-MySqlConnection

    This will simply providing help for the provider as well as writing the providers.
    It will add some redunant code between the Open-*Connection cmdlets, but little enough to be a problem.

Providers now simply need to have a config.ps1 in their folder, that file will control setting up the provider and exporting its cmdlet.
    If the provider requires adding types, then the provider class will need to be in a separate file (provider.ps1) and config.ps1 will need to dotsource
    it after it has added the required types.

Always roll version (minor) forward by 1 when updating provider nuget packages.
